abstract
abstract are non body class where we have abstract modifier which will apply onto the classess and the method only and if we use abstract on classess so we can't create te object of tat class instead we just
have to call the child method of that classes
  The Golden Rule: You cannot buy a blueprint; you have to build the house.
  In Java terms: You cannot create an object (new) of an Abstract Class. You can only create objects of the child classes that "fill in the blanks."
 abstract are use to sharing code not for contract
  abstract are use for this think
                                  common validation
                                  logging
                                  transaction tracking
                                  helper methods
                                  shared fields
                                  some default behavior

🧠 SO WHEN TO USE WHAT?
✔ Use INTERFACE when:

You only need a contract

There is no shared code

You want DI / loose coupling

You need multiple inheritance

You’re defining capabilities (Runnable, Comparable, etc.)

✔ Use ABSTRACT CLASS when:

You want to share code among related classes

You want fields (state)

You want constructors

You want default behavior that subclasses can extend

You want a “base class” that all child classes follow
