data hiding mean hide the internall data of the class from other class so taht no one can get direct access
they can acess through the some method like getter or setter jjust use private access modifier to do block access from other class
we haven't have thread safaty so we have to use Synchronization on the method
and also wthout private we don't have pure data hiding
 if we don't provide any setter so that object will called immutable object because it will fix by created adn don't change
 itself forever unitil it diea same as strng we create it and it never change unitil we reassign another String object with the same

Best Practices (Industrial)

✔ Always keep variables private
Even if you think exposing them is “easy.”

✔ Validate inputs inside setters
Never trust user data.

✔ Prefer immutability for value objects
Fewer bugs, safer in multithreading.
 ....................
✔ Don’t expose internal collections directly


| Exception                      | Meaning                                 |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `IllegalArgumentException`     | Wrong argument value                    |
| `IllegalStateException`        | Method called in wrong object state     |
| `IllegalThreadStateException`  | Invalid thread operation                |
| `IllegalMonitorStateException` | Using wait/notify without lock          |
| `IllegalAccessException`       | Reflection illegal access               |
| `IllegalAccessError`           | Runtime access violation                |
| `IllegalCallerException`       | Method called from wrong caller context |
| `IllegalFormatException`       | Bad format string                       |
